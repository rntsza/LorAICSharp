# LorAICSharp is legacy version
Discontinued

LorAi is a project what plays Legends of Runeterra automatically when he receive inputs for Twitch.tv/lorplays chat community(Pool-Based active learning), with a database keeping decisions for a future machine learning what will be included.
I'll made changes on development, AutoIT and OpenCV is not compatible because OpenCV runs in x64 Arch and AutoITx3 just work in x86.

Feel free to use that code for any purpose
